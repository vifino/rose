Rust Old Systems Emulator.

## What?

A library (+ a little more) for emulation of some CPUs and a few other nifty things.

Pluggable! In theory!

On it's own, it is more or less useless, if there would be a frontend to it, however, it'd make a neat emulator package, though.

## Why?

Because!

That and because most emulators are so... static. They have a tendency to not allow you to mess with the system. Obviously, one needs to mess with it.

## Why Rust?

Because I know many languages and Rust isn't one I am good at.

Plus, it has some neat things.
